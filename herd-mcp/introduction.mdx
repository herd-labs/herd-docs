# Herd MCP

Herd connects Claude Code to on-chain data through the Model Context Protocol. Query contracts, decode transactions, and analyze wallets using natural language.

## Supported Networks

| Network | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Ethereum | Supported |
| Base | Supported |

## Use Cases

**Developers** — Understand existing contracts before integrating. Search for specific patterns in verified source code.

**Security Researchers** — Audit contracts, trace exploit transactions, compare implementation versions.

**Analysts** — Track wallet activity, monitor token flows, investigate on-chain behavior.

## Example

```
> What does the swap function do in Uniswap V3 Router?

Claude fetches the contract, parses the source, and explains the swap logic.
```

```
> Decode transaction 0x1234...

Claude retrieves traces, logs, and balance changes, then summarizes what happened.
```

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | Use For | Example Query |
|------|---------|---------------|
| [Contract Metadata](/herd-mcp/tools/contract-metadata) | Contract/code summaries, enhanced ABI, token data, version history | "What is the main functionality of contract 0x...?" |
| [Code Analysis](/herd-mcp/tools/code-analysis) | Search contract code for proxy/implementations together | "Find who manages mints and auctions across functions" |
| [Diff Versions](/herd-mcp/tools/diff-versions) | Compare impl version upgrades | "What changed in the last contract upgrade?" |
| [Query Transaction](/herd-mcp/tools/query-transaction) | Decoded traces, logs, balances, transfers, and more | "What key transfers occured and why?" |
| [Latest Transactions](/herd-mcp/tools/latest-transactions) | Recent function/event calls with filters | "Show recent roles set in functions" |
| [Transaction Activity](/herd-mcp/tools/transaction-activity) | Address tx history with filters | "How has 0x... called morpho?" |
| [Wallet Overview](/herd-mcp/tools/wallet-overview) | Wallet profiling of transactions, positions, and deployments | "Overview of 0x..." |
| [Token Activity](/herd-mcp/tools/token-activity) | Token transfer history for a given position | "When did USDC get transferred for deposits?" |
| [Deployed Contracts](/herd-mcp/tools/deployed-contracts) | Find deployments from a wallet | "What contracts did 0x... deploy?" |
| [Get Bookmarks](/herd-mcp/tools/bookmarks) | List saved wallets, contracts, and transactions | "What do I have bookmarked?" |
| [Update Bookmarks](/herd-mcp/tools/bookmarks) | Add, rename, or remove a bookmark | "Bookmark this contract as 'My Token'" |
