# Herd MCP

Herd connects Claude Code to on-chain data through the Model Context Protocol. Query contracts, decode transactions, and analyze wallets using natural language.

## Supported Networks

| Network | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Ethereum | Supported |
| Base | Supported |

## Use Cases

**Developers** — Understand existing contracts before integrating. Search for specific patterns in verified source code.

**Security Researchers** — Audit contracts, trace exploit transactions, compare implementation versions.

**Analysts** — Track wallet activity, monitor token flows, investigate on-chain behavior.

## Example

```
> What does the swap function do in Uniswap V3 Router?

Claude fetches the contract, parses the source, and explains the swap logic.
```

```
> Decode transaction 0x1234...

Claude retrieves traces, logs, and balance changes, then summarizes what happened.
```
