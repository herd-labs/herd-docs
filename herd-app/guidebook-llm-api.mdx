After publishing a trail, anyone will be able to access the guidebook and API for the trail.

Go to the trail canvas or overlook and click the purple guidebook button at the start node. The rest is simple - select what you want to build and then copy the prompt/link and paste it into your AI tool of choice. Here [is an example generated in v0](https://v0.dev/chat/trail-api-implementation-Ipk7PqiYLXy) using the trail [split, deploy, collect](https://herd.eco/trails/019798af-793b-77e3-9e3f-afc3bcb06da8/overlook).

We highly recommend starting your app in v0, then creating a repo that you can take to cursor or any other tool for more granular edits. That's because v0 already sets up a lot of scaffolding for you in terms of package management, frameworks, and deployments - things that other tools may easily mess up if you're unlucky with the LLM.

Again, you can use this same prompt/link to generate automations, chatbots, or anything else ðŸ™‚

## Debugging the Trail API

If the AI tool you are working with runs into errors or gets stuck, try pasting the link/prompt again. Or go the trail overlook, and the test the read node/transaction step that the AI is getting stuck on - there will be an example you can then copy "LLM prompt" to give the AI a concrete example of how to work with the API. 

<Note>You can also check out the [API docs](../api-reference/introduction) for more details. It's highly recommended you just use the guidebook link for building on top of the API though.</Note>
