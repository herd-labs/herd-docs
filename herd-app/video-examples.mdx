We'll be adding trail walkthroughs here, you can always request a trail/guide in the Discord.

## USDC Payments Trail, Level: Easy ðŸŸ¢

Here's a short youtube video of me building a basic USDC payments trail. This is the easiest example for you to follow and build.

## Splits + Clanker Token Launcher Trail, Level: Medium ðŸŸ 

This four step trail shows off some of Herd's strengths in both the explorer and the various trail nodes (write, read, event, code). The contracts are fairly simple to follow, so this is a good guide to reference as you get deeper into trailblazing.
