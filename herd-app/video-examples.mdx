We'll be adding trail walkthroughs here, you can always request a trail/guide in the Discord.

## USDC Payment (Coffee App)

Here's a short youtube video of me building a basic USDC payments trail. This is the easiest example for you to follow and build.

## Splits + Clanker Token Launcher

This video is focused on actually building the trail, which is a four step trail that shows off some of Herd's strengths in both the explorer and the various trail nodes (write, read, event, code). The contracts are fairly simple to follow, so this is a good guide to reference as you get deeper into trailblazing.

## Build Your Own Crowdfund App

This guide spends a lot of time on how to vibe code an app in v0, and use various Herd trail features to help with debugging along the way. You'll be able to build a crowdfund from scratch, which you can then design and customize any way that you want to.

We did a herdathon for this, see [the submissions in replies here](https://farcaster.xyz/ilemi/0x6a6dfcd6).

## Build a Batch Token Swap App

Learn to use our swap component (0x API) and dune balances API in a trail, to then easily vibe code an app that lets you swap many tokens at once (thanks to EIP5792/7702).

See the [written guide here](https://read.cryptodatabytes.com/p/vibe-coding-a-batch-swap-app-using).
