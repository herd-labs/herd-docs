<Info>
  All data from the Herd Explorer is accessible in the [Herd MCP](/herd-mcp/introduction), which specializes in looking up relationships and context behind contracts, transactions, and wallets.
</Info>

## Learning the Basics

The Herd app has a [built in explorer](https://herd.eco/explorer) with an agent (Sage) who exists on every page to help you find and understand the chain. You can watch the video below for an overview of memory and the overall app.

If you haven't used a block explorer like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) before, explorers in crypto are used to investigate smart contracts, wallets, and transactions. Our explorer uses an LLM to interpret each of these objects, to provide richer context alongside all the data. 

<Info>The explorer and chat are NOT made for analytics, do not try and ask it Dune style analytical questions. It's targeted at understanding the logic and relationships between onchain objects.</Info>


## Ask Agent

You can utilize our agent to understand anything in Herd, by opening the chat in the bottom right. It will allow you tag context from the page, as well as add any contracts/transactions/wallets you want manually. This agent is also fully accessible via MCP for free.

## Explorer Pages

There are four main pages on the explorer, each focused on helping you quickly interpret and find onchain relationships. If you have any issues or feature requests, you can bring them up in [the Discord](https://discord.gg/NsfPWZZuKU).

### Contract Page

The contract page is a bit different from how other block explorers work:
- We start with a summary page, which is an LLM interpretation of all contract functions and events. If it's a token, it will also show top holders.
- If it's proxy, we show the underlying implementation directly. There is upgrade history in the dropdown in the top left so you can see all past versions

<Note>Herd works with verified and unverified Solidity and Vyper contracts (using Etherscan for verified, and Heimdall for unverified).</Note>

Next up we have a "related contracts" tab, which shows all the top contracts either calling or being called by the current address (as well as which functions are being called). This helps you quickly understand protocol relationships and key transaction drivers.

Then we have functions and events tabs, each with LLM summaries of what they handle as well as basic 1 day stats.

  />
</Frame>

Each function/event comes with it's own detailed page. It covers inputs/outputs, linked events, and shows most recent transactions calling this function (directly or indirectly). You can also copy just the individual function/event abi from here too.

</Frame>

Functions can also be executed directly on the page, with an LLM that helps you prepare inputs and simulate the transactions. You can also paste in a previous transaction calling this function to pre-fill the input values directly.

<Frame>

    alt="Herd function execution page" 
  />
</Frame>

There is a code tab as well, which lets you explore the proxy and contract code together (and search across them). The abi can be copied from here as well.

### Protocol Page

Many contracts will have protocol labels, such as "Circle", "Zora", "Uniswap", etc. These can be clicked to take you to the protocol page, showing main links to the protocol and also a chronological ordering of their deployed contracts.

</Frame>

If you notice any wrong or missing labels, you can message the team (on [Twitter](https://x.com/herd_eco) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/NsfPWZZuKU)).

### Transaction Page

We show an in depth summary with traces of each transaction (this works for any simulations you do on Herd as well).

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/explorer-transaction.png" 
    alt="Herd transaction page" 
  />
</Frame>

Each trace can be expanded so that you can view the summary, decoded data, and raw information together.

### Wallet Page

On the wallet page, we mainly showcase the top contracts they have called as well as top contracts they have deployed.
