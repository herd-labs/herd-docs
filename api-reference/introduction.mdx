The Herd Trails API enables developers to integrate blockchain trail execution and management into their applications. This RESTful API provides endpoints for retrieving trail configurations, managing user executions, and interacting with smart contracts.

## Base URL

```

```

## Authentication

All API requests do not require an API key at the moment. There is a rate limit in place, if you require higher limits please reach out to andrew@herd.eco.

## Core Concepts

### Trails
Trails are multi-step blockchain workflows that guide users through complex DeFi operations, NFT interactions, or other smart contract activities.

Each trail comes with a guidebook (a [txt file](https://trails-api.herd.eco/v1/trails/0197604c-f761-7ade-8a5c-5e50c2d834d4/versions/0197604c-f76a-779a-8f2e-e3ba236da2c6/guidebook.txt?promptObject=farcaster_miniapp)) that explains how to build/integrate it into an app, automation, chatbot, etc. This can be found in the trail overlook (like [this one](https://herd.eco/trails/0197604c-f761-7ade-8a5c-5e50c2d834d4/overlook)).

### Versions
Each trail can have multiple versions, allowing for updates and improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Executions
Executions track a user's progress through a trail, recording transaction hashes and step completion status.

### Nodes
Nodes represent individual operations within a trail step - reading from contracts, executing transactions, or processing data.

## Getting Started

1. **Retrieve a trail**: Use the guidebook endpoints to get trail configuration
2. **Collect user inputs**: Gather required information for each step
3. **Get transaction data**: Use the evaluations endpoint to generate calldata
4. **Execute transaction**: Have users sign and submit the transaction
5. **Save progress**: Record the transaction hash via the executions endpoint

## Rate Limiting

- Avoid high-frequency polling of endpoints
- Cache guidebook data when possible
- Use execution queries efficiently
