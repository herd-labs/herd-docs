title: 'Query Execution History'
openapi: 'POST /v1/trails/{trailId}/versions/{versionId}/executions/query'
---

Retrieves execution history for a trail, grouped by wallet address. Use this to display user progress, transaction feeds, and leaderboards.

## Overview

This endpoint returns comprehensive execution data including:
- **totals**: Aggregate statistics across all filtered wallets
- **walletExecutions**: Detailed execution data per wallet address
- **stepStats**: Transaction counts and recent transactions per step
- **farcasterData**: Social profile information for each wallet

## Request Body

```json
{
  "walletAddresses": ["0x...", "0x..."] // filter by specific wallet addresses
}
```

## Response Structure

### Totals Object
- **transactions**: Total transactions across filtered wallets (excluding step 0)
- **wallets**: Total wallets that completed more than step 0  
- **stepStats**: Per-step statistics with recent transaction hashes

### Wallet Executions Array
Each wallet contains:
- **walletAddress**: Always lowercase
- **executions**: Array of separate execution instances (don't merge these)
- **farcasterData**: Social profile info (username, pfp_url, display_name, etc.)
- **txnsPerStep**: Transactions organized by step number

## Farcaster Integration

Profile data includes:
- **username**: Link to profile with `https://farcaster.xyz/{username}`
- **pfp_url**: Profile picture URL
- **display_name**: User's display name
- **fid**: Farcaster ID
- **bio**: User bio
- **followers/following**: Social metrics

Profile data can be `null` if user doesn't have a Farcaster account.

## Use Cases

- **User Progress**: Show current step and transaction history for connected wallet
- **Transaction Feeds**: Display recent activity across all users
- **Leaderboards**: Rank users by completion or participation
- **Social Features**: Show profile pictures and usernames

## Important Notes

- **Don't merge executions**: Each execution is independent and should be used separately
- **Filter step 0**: All executions have a step 0 with nil hash - exclude from user-facing displays  
- **Lowercase addresses**: All wallet addresses are returned in lowercase
- **Execution selection**: Users can select specific executions via `latestExecutionId`

## Recommended Implementation

1. Query with connected wallet address in `walletAddresses`
2. Build step components using `walletExecutions[].txnsPerStep`
3. Show social profiles using `farcasterData` 
4. Display aggregate stats from `totals.stepStats`
5. Allow users to select executions for continuation
