title: 'Get Execution By Id'
openapi: 'GET /v1/trails/{trailId}/versions/{versionId}/executions/{executionId}'
---

Retrieves detailed information about a specific execution, including all completed steps and their transaction data.

## Overview

This endpoint returns comprehensive execution data including:
- Execution metadata (ID, creation/update timestamps)
- Completed steps with transaction hashes
- Block timestamps and numbers for each transaction
- Step evaluations and contract addresses

## Response Structure

Each execution contains:
- **steps**: Array of completed steps
- **stepNumber**: The step number in the trail
- **nodeId**: UUID of the primary node for this step  
- **txHash**: Transaction hash for the step
- **txBlockTimestamp**: When the transaction was included in a block
- **txBlockNumber**: Block number of the transaction
- **evaluation**: Contract address and final input values used

## Use Cases

- Tracking progress of a user's trail execution
- Displaying transaction history for an execution
- Debugging failed or incomplete executions
- Showing proof of completion for specific steps

## Important Notes

- All executions include a step 0 with a nil transaction hash - filter this out when displaying to users
- Step numbers start from 1 for actual trail steps
- Block timestamps can be converted to dates with `new Date(timestamp * 1000)`
