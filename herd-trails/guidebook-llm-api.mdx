# The Guidebook (LLM + API)

After publishing a trail, you will be able to access the guidebook. This is an API for using a trail outside of Herd (getting execution calldata from user inputs to each step, managing execution history).

Go to the trail canvas and click the purple button above the start of trail node, or the overlook description node. The rest is simple - select what you want to build (farcaster miniapp, web app, or a script) and then copy the prompt/link and paste it into your AI tool of choice. Here [is an example generated in v0](https://v0.dev/chat/trail-api-implementation-Ipk7PqiYLXy) using the trail [split, deploy, collect](https://herd.eco/trails/019798af-793b-77e3-9e3f-afc3bcb06da8/overlook).

We highly recommend starting your app in v0, then creating a repo that you can take to cursor or any other tool for more granular edits. That's because v0 already sets up a lot of scaffolding for you in terms of package management, frameworks, and deployments - things that other tools may easily mess up if you're unlucky with the LLM.

You can use this same prompt/link to generate automations, chatbots, or anything else too ðŸ™‚

## Debugging the Trail API

If the AI tool you are working with runs into errors or gets stuck, try pasting the link/prompt again. Or go the trail overlook, and the test the read node/transaction step that the AI is getting stuck on - there will be an example you can then copy "LLM prompt" to give the AI a concrete example of how to work with the API.
