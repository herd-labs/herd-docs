# Primer on Herd Explorer/Sage Chat

<Info>
You can watch the video below for an overview of memory and the overall explorer app

The Herd app is built as an explorer with an agent (Sage) who exists on every page to help you find and understand the chain. In the image below, the top bar is the search bar, which will search for contracts, tokens, and protocols based on your query.

See below, where we search for "clanker" and the results show a bit about the contract and then have a red plus/minus button. This is used for adding or removing a contract from memory.

You can navigate to different pages and the `chatId` should stay in context. **Note that for trails, you will only have ONE conversation tied to the trail and it CANNOT be changed.**

Memory acts as a shortcut for referencing objects in Herd (chat, trails, more in the future). If you've used Cursor, then this will be familiar to you. If not, just think of this as your "shopping cart" of objects while using Herd.

Herd's chat works the same way any other LLM chat app does. It uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model so expect succinct responses. Its primary function is to provide contextual answers about contract functions/events/behaviors.

**TL;DR: Use search and memory to add contracts that you want to reference in Trail creation.**
