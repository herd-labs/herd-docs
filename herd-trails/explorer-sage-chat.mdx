## Learning the Basics

The Herd app is built as an explorer with an agent (Sage) who exists on every page to help you find and understand the chain. You can watch the video below for an overview of memory and the overall explorer app.

If you haven't used an explorer like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io) before, explorers in crypto are used to investigate smart contracts, wallets, and transactions. Our explorer uses an LLM to interpret each of these objects, to provide richer context alongside all the data. 

<Info>The explorer and chat are NOT made for analytics, do not try and ask it Dune style analytical questions. It's targeted at understanding the logic and relationships between onchain objects.</Info>


## Search and Memory

In the image below, the top bar is the search bar, which will search for contracts, tokens, and protocols based on your query.

See below, where we search for "clanker" and the results show a bit about the contract and then have a red plus/minus button. This is used for adding or removing a contract from memory.

</Frame>

You can navigate to different pages and the `chatId` should stay in context. **Note that for trails, you will only have ONE conversation tied to the trail and it CANNOT be changed.**

Memory acts as a shortcut for referencing objects in Herd (chat, trails, more in the future). If you've used Cursor, then this will be familiar to you. If not, just think of this as your "shopping cart" of objects while using Herd.

Herd's chat works the same way any other LLM chat app does. It uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model so expect succinct responses. Its primary function is to provide contextual answers about contract functions/events/behaviors.

## Explorer Pages

### Contract Page

The contract page is a bit different from how other explorers work:
- We start with a summary page, which is an LLM interpretation of all contract functions and events. If it's a token, it will also show top holders.
- If it's proxy, we show the underlying implementation directly. There is upgrade history in the dropdown in the top left so you can see all past versions

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/explorer-contract.png" 
    alt="Herd contract summary page" 
  />
</Frame>

Next up we have a "related contracts" tab, which shows all the top contracts either calling or being called by the current address (as well as which functions are being called). This helps you quickly understand protocol relationships and key transaction drivers.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/explorer-related.png" 
    alt="Herd contract related tab" 
  />
</Frame>

Then we have functions and events tabs, each with LLM summaries of what they handle as well as basic 1 day stats.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/explorer-functions-tab.png" 
    alt="Herd functions tab page" 
  />
</Frame>

Each function/event comes with it's own detailed page. It covers inputs/outputs, linked events, and shows most recent transactions calling this function (directly or indirectly).

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/explorer-function-details.png" 
    alt="Herd functions tab page" 
  />
</Frame>

Functions can also be executed directly on the page, which an LLM that helps you prepare inputs and simulate the transactions. You can also paste in a previous transaction calling this function to pre-fill the input values directly.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/explorer-function-execute.png" 
    alt="Herd function execution page" 
  />
</Frame>

### Protocol Page

Many contracts will have protocol labels, such as "Circle", "Zora", "Uniswap", etc. These can be clicked to take you to the protocol page, showing main links to the protocol and also a chronological ordering of their deployed contracts.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/explorer-protocol.png" 
    alt="Herd function execution page" 
  />
</Frame>

If you notice any wrong or missing labels, you can message the team (on Twitter, Telegram, or Discord).

### Transaction Page

We show an in depth summary with traces of each transaction (this works for any simulations you do on Herd as well).

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/explorer-transaction.png" 
    alt="Herd transaction page" 
  />
</Frame>

Each trace can be expanded so that you can view the summary, decoded data, and raw information together.

    alt="Herd transaction expand page" 
  />
</Frame>

### Wallet Page

On the wallet page, we mainly showcase the top contracts they have called as well as top contracts they have deployed.
